- it's a container for data that can have any number of dimensions. In PyTorch (and other deep learning libraries), tensors are the core data structure used to build and train models.
- | Concept | Example | Shape |
  | ---- | ---- | ---- |
  | Scalar | `3` | `()` |
  | Vector | `[1, 2, 3]` | `(3,)` |
  | Matrix | `[[1, 2], [3, 4]]` | `(2, 2)` |
  | 3D Tensor | `[[[1], [2]], [[3], [4]]]` | `(2, 2, 1)` |
  | N-D Tensor | (Higher-dimensional data, like images or videos) | e.g. `(3, 224, 224)` for a color image |
