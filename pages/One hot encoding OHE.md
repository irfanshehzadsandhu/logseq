  ```
  vect = CountVectorizer()
   an instance of `CountVectorizer()`**, which is used to **convert text data into a bag-of-words representation**.

  ohe_rep = vect.fitohe_rep = vect.fit_transform(corpus)
  r text data) and transforms it into a [[Sparse Matrix]] 
   representation.**
- `fit_transform()` **does two things**:
	- **Learns the vocabulary** (unique words in the corpus).
	- **Transforms text into a matrix of token counts**.
	  
	  âœ” **Example Input (`corpus`)**
	  
	  ``corpus = ["This is good", "Excellent work!", "Good work is appreciated"]
	  ]
	  ```
	  
	  âœ” **Transformed Output (`ohe_rep`)** (Sparse Matrix)

	  (1, 1)   1   # "excellent" appears once in sentence 1
	  (1, 5)   1   # "work" appears once in sentence 1
	  (2, 0)   1   # "appreciated" appears once in sentence 2
	  (2, 2)   1   # "good" appears once in sentence 2
	  (2, 3)   1   # "is" appears once in sentence 2
	  (2, 5)   1   # "work" appears once in sentence 2
	  : The matrix stores word occurrences per document (row).

	  features = vect.features = vect.get_feature_names_out()
	   (feature names) as a NumPy array.**
- These are the **words** that `CountVectorizer` recognized in the `corpus`.
  
  âœ” **Example Output (`features`)**
  
  ``array(['appreciated', 'excellent', 'good', 'is', 'this', 'work'], dtype=object)
  )

  features[:20]
  s the first 20 words from the vocabulary.**
- Since the vocabulary size depends on the corpus, this might return **fewer** than 20 words.
  
  âœ” **Example Output**
  
  ``array(['appreciated', 'excellent', 'good', 'is', 'this', 'work'], dtype=object)
  )
  ```

  ohe_rep.shape
   the shape of the one-hot encoded representation (sparse matrix).**
- **Format:** `(number of sentences, vocabulary size)`
  
  âœ” **Example Output**
  
  ``(3, 6)  # 3 sentences, 6 unique words

  'good' in features
