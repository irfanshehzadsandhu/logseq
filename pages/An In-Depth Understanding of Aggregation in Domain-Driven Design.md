- Main points
	- The essence of aggregation is to establish a boundary greater than the object granularity and gather those closely related objects to form a complete business object.
-
- ## Principles of Aggregation Partition
	- Consistency of the Lifecycle
	- Consistency of the Problem Domain
		- Its more related to bounded context. Its says objects that do not belong to the same problem domain should not appear in the same aggregation.
	- Consistency of the Scenario Frequency (Still needs a clarification)
	- As Few Elements as Possible within the Aggregation
		- In this writer is taking approver id and submitter id as value objects and I am confused.
