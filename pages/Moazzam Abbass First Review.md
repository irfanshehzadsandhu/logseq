	- Before Starting review I want to share I have found moazzam very hard working and I believe he has a strong potential. Remember this review is to motivate you , help to grow in your career and to build a trust between you and me.
	- ## Please discuss the employee along the lines of technical skills
		- ### Core Engineering
			- Moazzam has understanding of design patterns, layered architecture, refactoring and Testing. He articulate his thoughts with me regularly.
		- ### Deep Expertise
			- There are six levels of knowledge. (1- Remembering, 2- Understanding, 3 - Applying - 4- Analyzing. See things from different angles, 5- Evaluating using critical thinking, 6 -Creating) as explained in this [link](https://helpfulprofessor.com/levels-of-knowledge/)
			- So I consider Moazzam at level 2 and some portion from applying level. For example he himself understood hexapp and figured out how to implement hexapp concepts in DMS.  He has good understanding of main technologies, frameworks, and libraries but he needs to work on next level applying .
		- ### Broad Knowledge
			- Moazzam has prior knowledge of framework and database. I found him he discuss his prior knowledge and discuss pros and cons of specific approach before implementing it . Example is discussing aggregate root issue of documents and tags
	- ## How well direct report is able to acquire new skill sets?
		- Acquiring new skill sets having following properties
			- Set your goal
				- Moazzam set his quarterly goal in 1:1. E.g he set his goal to become fullstack developer.
			- Set Deadline
				- I have found Moazzam set flexible deadlines.
			- Tools to learn
				- Although moazzam looks for different blogs to understand things and his favorite tool is chatGPT
			- Seek out additional resources
				- I have found he looks for additional links and blogs while training and learning new skills
			- Get Feedback
			-
		- Action Items can be
			- Apply 80/20 rule.
			- Use mistake as learning tools
	- ### Please discuss the employee along the lines of productivity
		- ### Speed of delivery
			- Moazzam lacks the ability to break tasks into smaller manageable parts. I found him he started working on a given task without breaking to smaller milestones. As he doesn't break down bigger problem into smaller problem his speed of delivery effects.
		- ### Stability of output
			- Moazzam is under training and I reviewed his code , his changes were minimum after review. I am not sure at this time about his stability of output .
		- ### Speed of learning and obtaining new context
			- His speed of learning is slow. Reason for slowness is he has curiosity to dig things deeply and tries to grasp concepts completely . As for as helping others learn a new context I think he is able to work in pair and a good team player
	- ## Rate the employee on how well they understood the business and whether they were able to add value to the business workflow or created clarity internally for team members
		- I believe he has an ability to understand business and is able to add value to a business but he depressed  me while work with Musab Akram on navarino project. I think he communicated not well with him.
	- ## Can you give an example of a time when they demonstrated proactiveness and ownership in their work? Do you feel they are an action-driven person?
		- Moazzam lacks some proactiveness skills like [Reference](https://climbtheladder.com/proactive-skills/)
			- Anticipate future problem
			- Time management
				- Time management is the ability to use your time wisely and efficiently. It involves planning and scheduling your time, as well as setting goals and objectives.
			- Communication
				- It means being proactive about reaching out to people, being proactive about setting up meetings, and being proactive about communicating your needs.
			- Prioritization
				- I found he prioritize, start by making a list of all the tasks and then rank them in order of importance.
			- Goal Setting
			- Delegation
				- Assigning tasks to others
			- Problem Solving
			- Stress Management
			-
		- I think he is an action driven person (You make good on your own commitments, and you make sure that other people do as well.).
	- ## Are they able to articulate their thought process clearly with internal and external stakeholders?
		- Have found he is able to articulate his thought process with me.
		- Needs to figure out when he was working with Musab Akram he didn't use this approach to share his thought process with him.
	- ## How well do they handle and give feedback in team meetings or code reviews? How well are they able to enable other team members in their work?
		- I have found Moazzam open and receptive during feedback. He listens actively and seek any clarification if required.
