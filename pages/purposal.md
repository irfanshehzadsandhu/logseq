  Hi Irfan,
  
  
  
  Would you be able to clone the repo to your system and get it deployed on Render.com? If you can do this and walk me through the steps to successfully do this myself that would be ideal.
  
  
  
  My app is a web scraper that predicts track and field team score by scraping current standings. The main issue I am experience is with the chrome executable path. Here is the repo: https://github.com/aidanhenn/team-scoring-app
  
  
  
  You should be able to submit this URL in the app and a table with scores will appear on the right hand side: https://www.tfrrs.org/lists/4718/Little_East_Outdoor_Performance_List
  
  
  
  Do you think you can do this?
  ```
