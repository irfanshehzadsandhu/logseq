- # Our goals for understanding the Domain
	- Understand Client's Business. Detail conversation with the domain expert
	- Identify processes beyond project scope
	- Look for subdomains we should include
	- Look for subdomains we can ignore
	-
- [#A] Listen to bounded context episode one more time. In that episode he is explaining client and billing bonded concepts
	- Questions: According to Eric Evan Its ideal you should have a separate db for each bounded context but in real world if separate database is not possible you can separate them conceptually

- # Elements of [[Domain Model]]
	- Eric Evans definition of Domain Layer
	- <ins>Responsible for representing concepts of the business, information about the business situation, and business rules. State that reflects the business situation is controlled and used here, even though the technical details of storing it are delegated to the infrastructure. This layer is the heart of business software.</ins>
	- Comparing Anemic and Rich Domain Model
		- The anemic domain model is described as **a programming anti-pattern where the domain objects contain little or no business logic like validations, calculations, rules, and so forth**.
		- Anemic model focuses on state management.
		- I think in my earlier projects I was only using anemic domain models
		- I think anemic word is derived from #Anemia is **a condition in which the body does not have enough healthy red blood cells**.
		- Why we are not using rich domain models?
		- [#A] Entity should be build using single responsibility principle. Evan says their core responsibility is identity and life-cycle.  Discuss about life-cycle in detail with Arslan

- # Understanding value objects and services in the Model
	- How money is [[Value Object]] ?
	- According to Evan date is a [[Value Object]].
	- Vaughn Vernon's Guidance
		- Is this a [[Value Object]]?
		- Otherwise entity
	- [[Value Object]] can be used as identifiers. I think in hexapp Arslan has introduced uuid as a value object
	- SideEffects: Find good example of side effect
- # Tackling Complexity with Aggregates

- # Terms used in tutorial
	- Interact with [[Domain Experts]]
	- Separate sub domains for each problem
	- Divide and conquer
	- Mind Map
	- #Modeling
	- Anti corruption layer
	- #Ubiquitiouslanguage
	- [[Domain Model]]
	- Difference between subdomain and bounded context? Eric evan gave an example of room and carpet.
	- context map
	- shared kernal
	- Event Modeling
	- Modeling: In general, modelling is **describing (mathematically) a situation in reality for the purpose of solving a problem or question in that situation**. Modelling is both a way of working and a way of thinking. So modeling a problem mean writing solution for a given problem ? Discuss it with Arslan
