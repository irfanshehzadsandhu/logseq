- # Monolithic Application
	- Monolithic application is one that is self contained , in terms of its behaviour. It may interact with other services and data stores but the core of its behaviour runs with the same process and entire application is deployed as a single unit
	- If such application needs to be scaled horizontally entire application will be duplicated across multiple servers or virtual machines
	- ### Disadvantages of Monolithic Application
		- Business logic is scattered between different layers. [[Business Logic and Business Rules]]
			- Take an example of rails application . I used to apply business rules in controllers and services
- # What are Layers?
	- As the application grows in complexity , application code can be divided into different layers according to their responsibilities and concerns
	- ## Advantages of Layers
		- Organising the code into layers have following advantages
			- Common low-level functionality can be reused across all the application, following the don't repeat yourself principle
				- <ins>DRY aims at reducing the repetition of software patterns , by replacing it with abstractions or data normalisation</ins>
			- Layered architecture helps Application to enforce restriction which layers can communicate with layers. This also help to achieve encapsulation.
			- Testing part is pending and will discuss it later with Arslan or any other peer.
- # Clean Architecture
	- Applications that follows [[Dependency Inversion Principle]] or domain driven design principles tend to arrive at a similar architecture (clean )
- Questions
	- What are swapping out implementations?
	- Data Access Layer ?
- Words and their meanings
	- Non-trivial: significant
	- Monolithic: formed of a single large block of stone
	- Low-level functions: Low level functions are functions who do not call other functions
	- mitigate: make something less severe, serious or painful
