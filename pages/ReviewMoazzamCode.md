- Why import is in js ? For example import { router as documentRoutes } from './Routes/Document.js' . Remove js
- Also there are un used lines e.g import koaBody from 'koa-body';
- What are these lines doing ? passport.use('jwt', jwtStrategy); and passport.use('refresh', refreshStrategy);
- Why import CustomError from "../../Infrastructure/Error/CustomError.js"; is in custom Error ? Self RND on this point .
- Remove console.log and use proper logger
- Understand how await next(); works ?
- What is AttachUserInfo?
- Still tag route ?
- Why we are not throwing error instead of this `return ctx.state.result = AppResult.Err(new errors.Unauthorized('Kindly check provided token'))`
- There should be AppResult in GlobalResponseHandler
- There should be separate dto file for each dto
- What is zip.ts file in Utils/zip.ts
- Why RedisClient in utils ?
- Please verify all edge cases , Hammad is going to check
